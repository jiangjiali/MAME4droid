      <h3>Supported Games<br>
      </h3>
      <p>MAME4droid (0.139u1) uses game ROMs from the MAME  '0.139' ROM set (August 2010). Note: This is different than the ROMs used in <em>MAME4droid (0.37b5)</em>. These ROMs cannot be used interchangeably.</p>
      <h3>ROM Location and Naming Convention</h3>
      <p>ROMs should be placed in the &quot;roms&quot; folder of your MAME4droid installation folder. In a default install of MAME4droid, this path is <em>/sdcard/MAME4droid/roms</em></p>
      <p>ROMs may be stored anywhere you like, but you'll need to change the path located under <em>Options-&gt;Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Change ROMs path</em></p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> File and directory names are case-sensitive. MRDO.ZIP is not the same  as mrdo.zip. Always use ZIPped ROMs with filenames in lower case..<br>
      </p>
      <h3>Sound Samples<br>
      </h3>
      <p>Some games' sound is not perfectly emulated by MAME. Therefore, digital sound files (known as <em>samples</em>) are used to complete the sound for these games.</p>
      <p>These should be placed in the <em>samples</em> folder within your MAME4droid installation; ZIPped and lower case filename (i.e. startrek.zip) In a default install of MAME4droid, this path is <em>/sdcard/MAME4droid/samples</em></p>
